# NLP_project

* It is a repository created for the Boaz association's mini-project.
* The project will continue until Sept. 1
* Final goal is to infer the MBTI based on the written characteristics of a person.

Purpose of this project
====================
1. To understand how to process Nature Language on Artificial intelligence, especially Tensorflow or keras (Like zero-padding, integer encoding, ...)
2. To understand Count-based word representations($e.g.$ BoW, TF-IDF) and word embeddings($e.g.$ Skip n-gram, Negative sampling), and can explain the difference between aboves.
3. To implement sequential model like RNN, LSTM, and Transformers or data visualization
4. To acquire basic knowledge that there is no problem in reading papers on NLP and models based on it

Dataset
======
[Kaggle MBTI Dataset, 106067 datas](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeyadkhalid/mbti-personality-types-500-dataset)

Weekly meeting
==============
Wednesday 11.5PM and Sunday 9.5AM, All members should attend the meeting.

The meeting will take about an hour and a half.
